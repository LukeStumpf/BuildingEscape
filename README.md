# BuildingEscape

Inspired by Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games Building Escape Tutorial via Udemy. 
This is a small tech demo to display my learning in UE4, with scripts written in C++.

Controls:
Movement - WASD for movement
Grab and release items - right click

How to Play:
Open the project in .uproject file in Unreal and press play to play in editor (having issues with packaging, still working on getting a .exe working)
Your goal is to escape the dungeon. Use the tools in the room to escape.

Feel free to open the project files and source code to see how it all works :)
